# quadcopter.js
I tried to code crazyflie using node.js language
Quadcopters have 4 blades and the cross propellers rotate in the same direction while the adjacent propellers rotate in the opposite direction.
It was my teknofest project. I couldn't test it because the test programs crashed on my computer.
